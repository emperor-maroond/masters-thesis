\section{Legged Locomotion}
Animals in nature move agilely with low effort obtained through thousands of years of evolution. Humans with their ever growing desire to create legged robots that is capable of robust movement, thus look at the years of evolution acquired through nature to aid them in the design of robotic platforms. On the scale of time, legged robotics is a new field and this can evidently be seen by the compilation of videos found throughout the internet of robots tumbling over, seeming at random. For every video of a robot falling over there emerges a video showing the amazing progress that has been made in the legged robotics field. Examples of these incredible platforms are the aforementioned Atlas by Boston Dynamics as well as the mini-cheetah by MIT, but these state of the art platforms are still few and far in between.
